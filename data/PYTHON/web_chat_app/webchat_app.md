### Elaboration
<p class="elaboration">
It involved the use of Flask, SQLAlchemy, encryption, and hashing to produce a secure web app that is client-oriented and allows secure signing and navigation through the app. It provides a suitable user interface and responses that make interaction livelier, such as Pop up messages to show when a user has logged in or logged out, or when a not has been added.
Passwords and user information is stored securely on a database that contains hashed data so it cannot be read from the server-side. I use pbkdf2 hashing, which uses SHA-256 repeatedly, with salting to make the hashing more secure.

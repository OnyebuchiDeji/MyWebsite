   Image Manipulation Project

### Briefing
<p class="briefing">
I use JS Canvas to manipulate pictures of an image to create cool effects!
<br>
Date Started:
</p>

<div id="main_image">
    <img src="data/JAVASCRIPT/image_manip/resources/image_manip_1.png"/>
</div>

### Elaboration
<p class="elaboration">
An OOP approach was used. A Cell and Effect class were made.
The Cell class was used to render a section of the image's pixels using some cool JS Canvas functions. This way, a grid of these cells was used to display the full image. Then the Effect class, which was used to make the grid was used to manipulate each pixel to cause some effect.
Then later, mouse position was gotten and used to manipulate the position of the pixels. This was used to create the effect.
Many kinds of effects were implemented -- some to spread out the pixels within the mouse's range, and another to draw them in like a sinkhole.
It inspired me to do the same thing with Python. It worked too!

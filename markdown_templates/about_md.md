#   About

### Overview
<p>
This static website was created using HTML, CSS, JS, and some Pypy.
It was meant for this Github static website hosting service.
It makes use of a Python script that is pretty robust but not yet OP,
but it works very well, and did not take much time.<br><br>

### Future Plans

**ELABORATION**
<p>
    The plan as of now is to use this static website to run some JS-based apps we create.
    It will also be used to advertise pictures of several other projects I create.<br>
    In conclusion, this web site will be built upon in the coming future, God-given.<br><br>


    Why? Because I have more tham three energies flowing through my veins, and each one is OP.
    I also have plot armor.<br>
    If I told you, you won't believe me. But I'll show you.<br><br>
    
    You're not alone? Yes, I have a super power that transcends time -- my soul, my consciousness and all in it and yes, we work together.<br>
    Why're you writng all of this? Because at the moment of writing this, I feel so hyped that it's almost complete.
